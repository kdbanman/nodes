#MISC
#####

- try stable processing 2 release

- update node and edge removal within Graph to maintain the model.

- updtae node removal process to remove all attached edges and singlet nodes

- refactor edge member predicates into a list of jena Statements
	- update label machinery accordingly

- implement Graph method to change color of selected nodes
- ... change label display of selected nodes

- (probably within main application loop) implement drag and drop movement of selected nodes.  keep in mind that the controller is currently prepared to prohibit the user from doing this unless the appropriate radio button is active.  this might be stupid.
	- remove drag and drop radio

- within main application loop, implement the auto layout of graph when the toggle is selected

- add radial lexicographical sorting (sensitive to common subject?  sounds expensive.  maybe just let the user dumbass if they want))

- add size tab (will require respacing other transform tabs)
	- size nodes
		- degree
		- betweenness centrality
		- relative lexicographic position (user defined scale)
	- size edges
		- number of predicates
		- betweenness centrality

#CLASSES AND INTERFACES
#######################

- implement basic graph stack
	- ensure deep copying (may have to keep within Graph so that references to it elsewhere don't get screwed up)

- write first few selection modifiers to unearth the necessary interface
	- test context-sensitivity with:
		- only nodes
		- only edges
		- clear selection

- implement error/notification popup window system

#CONTROL LOGIC
##############

- disable auto-layout as soon as its tab is not active

- populate selection modifiers based on selection nature

- disable certain sizing options based on selection nature

#MODIFIERS
##########

- select shortest path between 2 nodes

#OPTIONS
########

- exploration: colorize based on database or web retrieval
- exploration: get from web, database, or both

- implement web-retrieval of RDF from URI (will be used within control panel and in exploration mode)

- ugh.  merge with work machine for framed labels
