#MISC
#####
- finish radial layout.  add lexico
	- separate lexico and numerical ordering functions

- implement exploration mode

- test multiple additions for prefix overwrite (rdf then rdfs documents replicates)

- replicate and fix concurrent modification bug when adding triples.

- find out why initially displaying labels is very expensive.  even for one node or edge, a hover triggers a very noticeable lag time.  this scales to absolute unusability when only a few dozen labels are triggered for display at the same time (or even it too short an interval of time)
	- resizing the nodes is similarly expensive

- render labels centered on element position

- fix height/width of text background for labels.

- bolder font with higher contrast color. (pastel orange on default blue)

- brighten main background (scale to white)

- update node and edge removal within Graph to maintain the model.

- updtae node removal process to remove all attached edges and singlet nodes

- implement main application arrow controls for camera strafe

- (probably within main application loop) implement drag and drop movement of selected nodes.  keep in mind that the controller is currently prepared to prohibit the user from doing this unless the appropriate radio button is active.  this might be stupid.

- add radial lexicographical sorting (sensitive to common subject?  sounds expensive.  maybe just let the user dumbass if they want))

- find some way to swap state around to show color changes on selected nodes

- try stable processing 2 release
	
#CLASSES AND INTERFACES
#######################

- implement basic graph stack
	- ensure deep copying (may have to keep within Graph so that references to it elsewhere don't get screwed up)

- implement error/notification popup window system

- use classloader in constructor of Modifiers when populating modifier list for use of plugins

#CONTROL LOGIC
##############

- disable certain sizing options based on selection nature

#MODIFIERS
##########

- select shortest path between 2 nodes

#OPTIONS
########

- exploration: colorize based on database or web retrieval
- exploration: get from web, database, or both

- fix onLeave() inconsistency.  it happens only (but not always) when leaving an element with a mouse button held.
	- narrowed it down more:  when more than one element is hovered over at a time, then they are left with the mouse button held, only one of them will call onLeave().  the order of entrance in irrelevant, the one that doesn't have onLeave() called is constant for any particular group of elements.

- refactor mouse interaction
	- desired behaviour:
		- single, undragged click clears selection unless shift is pressed
			- subsequent release on an element adds it to selection
		- drag from outside an element box-selects
		- drag from within an element drag-moves
	- proposal:
		- rather than a drag behaviour enum in Nodes, keep a class that knows if the cursor is inside an element (and which element it is).  this would keep the selection and dragging logic out of the GraphElement class and inside the main application.
			- if it still makes sense to have an overarching DRAG or SELECT behaviour enum, this class should handle that derivation.

- add drag and drop movement
	- click and drag within node.  move entire selection
	- this is partially implemented, it required a behaviour toggle, and the movement is triggered properly, but doesn't move correctly
	- protect the onDrag() movement function with the DragBehaviour enum

- move SingleSelector to inner class of Node

- finish neighbor selection modifier

- populate listbox dynamically using populate() (for selection)

- hook up ListBox items to modify() function
	- maybe populate should maintain the listbox indices, and it should be sent Modifiers.run(event.group().value())
		- if this is the case, then Modifiers should maintain state - indices to modification methods.  perhaps a Map<Integer, Modifier>?

- write first few selection modifiers to unearth the necessary interface
	- test context-sensitivity with:
		- only nodes
		- only edges

- populate selection modifiers based on selection nature

- implement controlpanel method to change color of selected nodes

- implement controlpanel method to change size of selected nodes

- disable auto-layout as soon as its tab is not active

- implement control to change label display of selected graph elements

- implement control to change label size of selected graph elements

- remove drag and drop radio

- within main application loop, implement the auto layout of graph when the toggle is selected

- add size tab (will require respacing other transform tabs)
	- size nodes
		- degree
		- betweenness centrality
		- relative lexicographic position (user defined scale)
	- size edges
		- number of predicates
		- betweenness centrality
	NOTE:  size and color are just under the same tab.  sizing algorithms not for this version.  that's for when EVERYTHING gets all context-reactive

- ensure label size adjustment is in the label tab

- add paste functionality to text fields
	- probable best to extend the ControlP5 version and add a keylistener

- find and fix the cause of the SERIOUS performance hit after querying the web
	NOTE:  the performance hit doesn't come from querying the web, this is just a very resource-intensive program.  I only have so much control over performance optimizations since there is such heavy dependence upon ControlP5.  I have the choice:
		1) learn more about the guts of ControlP5 to stop unnecessary computation by better placement of method and state.
		2) reimplement the parts of the ControlP5 that I'm using for button/hover functionality, and structure the code for my 3D performance needs.

- refactor edge member predicates into a list of jena Triples (or something) (update label machinery accordingly)
	- this will greatly simplify matching Model query results to graph subsets
	- the current implementation of relations, where each edge has a map from predicates to boolean values (latter indicating direction), will overwrite the triple <A,B,C> if the triple <C,B,A> is added
	- question.  since edges are identified by source and destination node identifiers, is it still important to leave the triples unprefixed for uniqueness' sake?
		- yes. imagine the triple <aaaA,b:B,c:C> is added, then the prefix a (for aaa) is discovered, then the same triple is added again.  the new triple will be added to the list, which is incorrect.  
	- label prefixing isn't as simple as just iterating through labelText and prefixing each. (unless jena will replace all occurrences of nsPrefixMap keys in a string instead of just the first occurrence)  TESTED:  it will not.

- prexfixLabel() function iterates through lines, best called from addNode() and addEdge(), since that is when new prefixes could be discovered
	- push prefixing to label mechanism to avoid violating uniqueness of controller names.  
		- think about how to deal with edges properly.  probably similarly to nodes, but it will be a bit slow iterating through the predicates to check all of them.  actually no, there should never be so many predicates as to slow it down significantly, the code will just be a fair bit uglier

- label text content from String to List of Strings (lines of text) so that multiline literals are easy, and so is post-discovery prefixing.

- recalculateLabelDimensions() iterates through list.  should be called within prefixLabel() and anywhere else label is dicked with

- add prefix/unprefix triple methods to graph
	- ensure model is updated before any nodes/edges are created

- implement web-retrieval of RDF from URI (will be used within control panel and in exploration mode)

- ugh.  merge with work machine for framed labels
